# Most-Rated
United Remote Challenge

In my solutions to the Github Most Rated Repositories Challenge, I used 3 main Classes 
  - OperationQueue
  - JSONDecoder
  - URLSession
  
 I tried to keep both the Code and the User Interface simple, and to focus on the main goal of the app, which is to get a
 list of the most rated Github repositories from the month of 10/2017.
